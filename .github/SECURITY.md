## Reporting a Vulnerability

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is a trading system that handles financial transactions. Security issues could result in financial loss.**

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **DO NOT** discuss security issues in public channels

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by:

- Creating a private security advisory through GitHub's security tab
- Or emailing the maintainers directly (if email is available)

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact on trading operations
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Affected Components**: Which services or modules are affected
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
2. **Assessment**: Initial assessment within 48 hours
3. **Fix Development**: Security fixes will be prioritized
4. **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fix is available

### Security Considerations for Trading Systems

This system processes real financial data and executes trades. Key security areas include:

#### Data Integrity
- Price feed tampering could cause incorrect trades
- Signal manipulation could trigger unintended positions
- Order modification could result in financial loss

#### Access Control  
- Unauthorized access to trading functions
- Privilege escalation within the system
- Broker API key compromise

#### Infrastructure Security
- Container escape vulnerabilities
- Network segmentation issues
- Database injection attacks

#### Operational Security
- Log injection or manipulation
- Monitoring system compromise
- Backup/restore vulnerabilities

### Security Best Practices

When contributing to this system:

1. **Input Validation**: Validate all external inputs, especially price data
2. **Authentication**: Ensure proper authentication for all API endpoints
3. **Encryption**: Use TLS for all network communications
4. **Secrets Management**: Never hardcode credentials or API keys
5. **Logging**: Log security events but don't log sensitive data
6. **Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities

### Security Testing

We use the following security measures:

- **Static Analysis**: CodeQL scans for common vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning of dependencies  
- **Secret Scanning**: Automated detection of committed secrets
- **Container Security**: Hardened Docker images with minimal attack surface
- **Network Security**: NetworkPolicies to restrict inter-service communication

### Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate**: Stop trading activities if necessary
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
3. **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact
4. **Recovery**: Restore secure operations
5. **Post-Mortem**: Document lessons learned
