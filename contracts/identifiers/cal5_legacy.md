## Event Classification

### Tier 1 (Medium-High Impact)
- Quarterly GDP releases
- Monthly CPI data
- Manufacturing PMI

### Tier 2 (Medium Impact)  
- Services PMI
- Retail sales
- Employment data (non-NFP)

### Tier 3 (Medium-Low Impact)
- Sentiment surveys
- Secondary economic indicators
- Regional data

## Mapping Rules

### When to Use CAL5 vs CAL8
- **CAL8**: Use for high-impact, market-moving events
- **CAL5**: Use for medium-impact events that may influence but not dominate market movements

### Legacy Support
CAL5 identifiers provide backward compatibility for:
- Historical trade analysis
- Existing re-entry parameter sets
- Legacy indicator configurations

## Validation Rules

### Format Validation
- Must be exactly 5 characters plus `CAL5_` prefix
- Event code must be from approved list
- All characters must be alphanumeric (A-Z, 0-9)

### Usage Guidelines
- Prefer CAL8 for new high-impact events
- Use CAL5 for medium-impact events
- Maintain CAL5 support for legacy data

## Usage in Trading System

### Calendar Signal Generation
```python
# Example usage
calendar_id = "CAL5_GDPQ1"
symbol = "EURUSD"  # May be affected by Eurozone GDP
proximity_state = "POST_30M"  # Post-event stabilization
```

### Re-entry Context
CAL5 identifiers in Hybrid IDs indicate medium-impact calendar context:
```
L1_EXTENDED_POST_30M_CAL5_GDPQ1_SHORT_2
```

This indicates a losing extended trade during the post-event window of a medium-impact GDP release.

## Migration Path

### From CAL5 to CAL8
For events that become higher impact:
1. Create new CAL8 identifier
2. Update event classification
3. Maintain CAL5 for historical data
4. Document mapping in migration log

### Deprecation Process
1. Mark CAL5 event as deprecated
2. Provide CAL8 alternative
3. Update documentation
4. Maintain backward compatibility for 2 major releases
