Trading Strategy Framework & Market Thinking (sig4 continuation + sig1/sig2 cross-tie)

Taxonomy Expansion

From 11 archetypes → 53+ distinct strategies across Technical, Quantitative, Fundamental, Behavioral branches

sig4

.

Each defined by “DNA” attributes: signal persistence, strength, volatility preference, trend environment, edge source.

Levels of Market Thinking

Level 1 (Retail): Direct info→price reaction (buy good news, sell bad news).

Level 2 (Contrarian): Fades obvious moves, exploits overcrowding (“buy rumor, sell news”).

Level 3 (Institutional): Engineers traps/liquidity, orchestrates L1 & L2.

Dynamics: L1 creates momentum, L2 fades, L3 exploits both.

Execution Logic

Taxonomy of entry/exit orders, stop/take-profit structures, dynamic order management, multi-leg handling.

Idea Capture

Framework to systematize trading insights into structured, testable components.

Quantification Concepts

Market Obviousness Index (MOI) – measures “obviousness” of moves (breakout clarity, volume, news direction).

Contrarian Overcrowding Index (COI) – sentiment extremes, divergence, low fear complacency.

Smart Money Activity Index (SMAI) – price/volume divergence, order flow patterns.

Data Sources & Access (sig2/sig3/sig4 with reinforcement from sig1)

Free/Open Data

Dukascopy, TrueFX, HistData.com (ticks, candles).

FRED, CFTC COT, Yahoo Finance, CME futures, ETF IV proxies.

OANDA/FXCM APIs for streaming ticks, order book, sentiment

sig3

.

Synthesis Methods

Multi-broker aggregation for spreads/tick frequency.

Futures volume + spot tick volume = synthetic depth/volume proxies.

Order book approximations via broker APIs.

Integration Challenge

MQL4 cannot directly fetch APIs → requires preprocessing (Python/batch→CSV) then FileOpen/FileReadString.

✅ Key Takeaways

The four documents collectively define a complete multi-layer trading architecture:

sig1: Technical indicators & empirical signal system, with UI/UX brainstorm.

sig2/sig3: Cross-asset feature factory, indicator recipes, data pipelines, manifests, governance.

sig4: Extensions—gap analysis, regime detection modules, adaptive windows, and market-thinking taxonomy turned into quantifiable indicators.

Together, they show a unified design blending:

Traditional TA → empirical probability.

Cross-asset/macro drivers → engineered features.

Psychological/behavioral frameworks → quantified thresholds.

Implementation blueprints in both Python and MQL4.
