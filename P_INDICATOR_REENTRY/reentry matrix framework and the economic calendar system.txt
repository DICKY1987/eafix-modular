Looking at your reentry matrix framework and the economic calendar system, I can see the integration challenge clearly. The economic calendar provides time-specific signals that need to feed into your multi-dimensional matrix, but you need a unified identification system that handles both calendar-based and other volatility signals.
Economic Calendar Integration Framework
1. Signal Type Mapping & Enhancement
Expand the existing 8 signal types to accommodate calendar specificity:
Current: ECO_HIGH, ECO_MED, ANTICIPATION_1HR, ANTICIPATION_8HR, EQUITY_OPEN_ASIA/EUROPE/USA, ALL_INDICATORS

Enhanced: 
- ECO_HIGH_USD, ECO_HIGH_EUR, ECO_HIGH_GBP, ECO_HIGH_JPY (country-specific)
- ECO_MED_USD, ECO_MED_EUR, ECO_MED_GBP, ECO_MED_JPY
- ANTICIPATION_1HR_USD, ANTICIPATION_1HR_EUR, etc.
- ANTICIPATION_8HR_USD, ANTICIPATION_8HR_EUR, etc.
- EQUITY_OPEN_ASIA, EQUITY_OPEN_EUROPE, EQUITY_OPEN_USA (unchanged)
- VOLATILITY_SPIKE, CORRELATION_BREAK (new non-calendar signals)
2. Hybrid Identification System
Bridge your 5-digit calendar strategy IDs with matrix combination IDs:
Complete Signal ID Format: [CALENDAR_ID]:[MATRIX_COMBINATION_ID]

Examples:
10124:O:ECO_HIGH_USD:FLASH:O4:FSHORT    # USA Medium impact + Matrix combination
20136:R1:ECO_HIGH_EUR:QUICK:O2:FLONG    # EUR High impact + First reentry
00000:O:VOLATILITY_SPIKE:FLASH:O6:FIMM  # Non-calendar signal
Calendar ID component:

00000 = Non-calendar signal
5-digit = Calendar-based (your existing system)

3. Signal Generation Logic
Calendar Event Processing Pipeline:
pythondef process_calendar_event(event_data):
    # Generate base 5-digit strategy ID
    calendar_id = generate_logical_strategy_id(event_data.country, event_data.impact)
    
    # Determine signal types to generate
    signals = []
    
    # Main event signal
    if event_data.impact == "High":
        signals.append(f"ECO_HIGH_{event_data.country}")
    elif event_data.impact == "Medium":
        signals.append(f"ECO_MED_{event_data.country}")
    
    # Anticipation signals
    signals.append(f"ANTICIPATION_1HR_{event_data.country}")
    signals.append(f"ANTICIPATION_8HR_{event_data.country}")
    
    # Generate matrix combinations for each signal
    for signal in signals:
        for outcome in range(1, 7):
            for proximity in ["IMMEDIATE", "SHORT", "LONG", "EXTENDED"]:
                for generation in ["O", "R1", "R2"]:
                    # Duration only for ECO signals
                    if "ECO_" in signal:
                        for duration in ["FLASH", "QUICK", "MEDIUM", "LONG", "EXTENDED"]:
                            combination_id = f"{generation}:{signal}:{duration}:O{outcome}:F{proximity}"
                            full_id = f"{calendar_id}:{combination_id}"
                    else:
                        combination_id = f"{generation}:{signal}:O{outcome}:F{proximity}"
                        full_id = f"{calendar_id}:{combination_id}"
4. Proximity Integration
Map calendar proximity to matrix proximity:
Calendar Minutes to Event → Matrix Proximity
0-15 minutes = IMMEDIATE
16-60 minutes = SHORT  
61-240 minutes = LONG
241+ minutes = EXTENDED
Dynamic proximity updates:
pythondef update_proximity_in_real_time():
    current_time = get_current_time()
    
    for active_signal in get_active_calendar_signals():
        minutes_to_event = calculate_minutes_to_event(active_signal.event_time, current_time)
        new_proximity = map_minutes_to_proximity(minutes_to_event)
        
        # Update matrix combination if proximity changed
        if new_proximity != active_signal.current_proximity:
            update_matrix_combination(active_signal.id, new_proximity)
5. Multi-Source Signal Coordination
Handle overlapping signals from different sources:
Priority System:
1. ECO_HIGH_* (highest priority)
2. ECO_MED_*
3. ANTICIPATION_1HR_*
4. ANTICIPATION_8HR_*
5. EQUITY_OPEN_*
6. VOLATILITY_SPIKE
7. ALL_INDICATORS (lowest priority)
Conflict resolution:
pythondef resolve_signal_conflicts(active_signals):
    # Sort by priority
    sorted_signals = sort_by_priority(active_signals)
    
    # Check for conflicts
    for i, signal in enumerate(sorted_signals):
        for j, other_signal in enumerate(sorted_signals[i+1:]):
            if signals_conflict(signal, other_signal):
                # Suppress lower priority signal
                suppress_signal(other_signal)
    
    return get_active_signals()
6. Enhanced Parameter Set Mapping
Integrate calendar strategy IDs with matrix parameter selection:
pythondef get_parameter_set_for_reentry(trade_close_event):
    # Calculate outcome, duration, proximity from trade data
    outcome = classify_outcome(trade_close_event)
    duration = calculate_duration_category(trade_close_event)
    proximity = get_current_proximity_to_next_event()
    generation = determine_generation(trade_close_event)
    
    # Check if there's an active calendar signal
    calendar_signal = get_active_calendar_signal(trade_close_event.symbol)
    
    if calendar_signal:
        # Use calendar-enhanced signal type
        signal_type = calendar_signal.enhanced_signal_type
        calendar_id = calendar_signal.strategy_id
    else:
        # Use default signal type
        signal_type = "ALL_INDICATORS"
        calendar_id = "00000"
    
    # Generate matrix combination ID
    combination_id = generate_combination_id(generation, signal_type, outcome, proximity, duration)
    
    # Create full hybrid ID
    full_id = f"{calendar_id}:{combination_id}"
    
    # Lookup parameter set
    parameter_set_id = get_parameter_set_for_combination(full_id)
    
    return parameter_set_id
7. Event Lifecycle Management
Track calendar events through their lifecycle:
Event States:
- SCHEDULED: Event exists in calendar, not yet active
- ANTICIPATION_8HR: 8 hours before event
- ANTICIPATION_1HR: 1 hour before event  
- ACTIVE: Event is happening (±15 minutes)
- COOLDOWN: 30 minutes after event
- EXPIRED: Event impact period ended
State transition logic:
pythondef update_event_states():
    for event in get_calendar_events():
        current_state = event.state
        minutes_to_event = calculate_minutes_to_event(event)
        
        new_state = determine_state_from_timing(minutes_to_event)
        
        if new_state != current_state:
            transition_event_state(event, current_state, new_state)
            update_active_signals(event, new_state)
8. Integration with Existing Matrix
Enhance your current matrix population logic:
pythondef populate_enhanced_matrix():
    # Get all possible calendar strategy IDs
    calendar_ids = get_all_calendar_strategy_ids()
    calendar_ids.append("00000")  # Add non-calendar option
    
    # Get all enhanced signal types
    enhanced_signals = get_enhanced_signal_types()
    
    # Generate all combinations
    for calendar_id in calendar_ids:
        for signal in enhanced_signals:
            # Skip invalid combinations
            if calendar_id == "00000" and is_calendar_signal(signal):
                continue
            if calendar_id != "00000" and not is_calendar_signal(signal):
                continue
                
            # Generate matrix combinations for this signal
            combinations = generate_matrix_combinations(signal)
            
            for combination in combinations:
                full_id = f"{calendar_id}:{combination}"
                assign_default_parameter_set(full_id)
9. Real-Time Integration Workflow
Complete integration process:

Calendar Import: Process ForexFactory data, generate 5-digit strategy IDs
Signal Generation: Create enhanced signal types with country specificity
Matrix Population: Generate hybrid IDs for all valid combinations
Real-Time Updates: Update proximity and event states continuously
Trade Decision: Use hybrid ID system for parameter set lookup
Execution: Apply calendar-aware parameters to reentry decisions

This framework bridges your economic calendar system with the reentry matrix while maintaining the logical structure of both systems. The hybrid ID approach allows you to track both the calendar context and the matrix position for each trading decision.Probing potential complexities in economic calendar integration framework13sI think I've provided a comprehensive framework for integrating the economic calendar into the reentry matrix system. Let me review what I've covered:

Signal Type Mapping & Enhancement - I proposed expanding the existing 8 signal types to be country-specific for calendar events, which makes sense given that different countries' economic events can have different impacts.
Hybrid Identification System - I created a bridge between the 5-digit calendar strategy IDs and the matrix combination IDs by using a format like [CALENDAR_ID]:[MATRIX_COMBINATION_ID]. This maintains both systems while creating a unified identifier.
Signal Generation Logic - I showed how to process calendar events and generate the appropriate signals, including both main event signals and anticipation signals.
Proximity Integration - I mapped calendar timing (minutes to event) to the matrix proximity categories, which is essential for the system to work properly.
Multi-Source Signal Coordination - I addressed how to handle conflicts when multiple signals are active simultaneously, with a priority system.
Enhanced Parameter Set Mapping - I showed how the hybrid ID system would work in practice for looking up parameter sets.
Event Lifecycle Management - I created a state system for tracking calendar events through their lifecycle, from scheduled through cooldown.
Integration with Existing Matrix - I showed how to enhance the existing matrix population logic to handle the new hybrid system.
Real-Time Integration Workflow - I provided a complete process flow for how this would work in practice.

I think this covers the main integration challenges the user identified. The approach maintains the logical structure of both the economic calendar system and the reentry matrix while creating a unified framework that can handle both calendar-based and non-calendar-based signals.
The user will probably want to discuss specific implementation details or potential issues with this approach. Some areas that might need more exploration:

How to handle the increased complexity of having country-specific signal types
Database schema changes needed to support the hybrid ID system
Performance implications of the expanded matrix size
Testing strategies for the integrated system
Migration path from the current system to the enhanced system

I'll need to carefully analyze the computational overhead of expanding the matrix. Increased dimensionality could exponentially grow computational complexity, potentially requiring optimized data structures and more efficient processing algorithms. Comprehensive testing will be crucial, involving both unit and integration tests to validate the new hybrid system's reliability and performance.
The migration strategy must be incremental, allowing parallel system operation to minimize risk. I'll develop a phased approach that enables gradual transition, with robust rollback mechanisms and comprehensive monitoring to ensure system stability during the upgrade process.RetryDCreate document that shows how it all fits together Do not write code just a high level plain English document So I can get an idea of where we're atEditMapped system components to create comprehensive overview documentThe user wants me to create a high-level, plain English document that shows how the entire system fits together. They don't want code, just a conceptual overview of how all the pieces we've been discussing integrate. Based on our conversation, the main components are:

The reentry subsystem with its multi-dimensional decision matrix
The economic calendar system with 5-digit strategy IDs
The integration between calendar events and matrix signals
The parameter management system
The risk management and capital preservation aspects
The communication between Excel and MT4

I need to create a document that explains how these all work together as one cohesive system, written in plain English without technical jargon or code snippets.Integrated Economic Calendar Reentry Trading System
High-Level System Architecture Overview
System Purpose
This system automates forex reentry decisions by combining economic calendar events with a multi-dimensional decision matrix. When a trade closes, the system evaluates the market context and recent performance to determine whether to re-enter, what parameters to use, and how to manage risk.
Core Components Overview
1. Economic Calendar Foundation
The system starts with economic calendar data (primarily from ForexFactory) that gets processed and assigned unique 5-digit strategy identifiers. These identifiers encode the country and impact level of each economic event using a logical regional-country-impact structure. For example, a US high-impact event gets a different ID than a European medium-impact event.
2. Multi-Dimensional Decision Matrix
The heart of the system is a decision matrix that considers multiple factors when a trade closes:

Signal Type: What caused the original trade (economic event, equity market open, anticipation signal, etc.)
Outcome: How the closed trade performed (full stop loss, partial loss, breakeven, partial profit, full take profit, beyond take profit)
Duration: How long the trade lasted (flash, quick, medium, long, extended)
Proximity: How close we are to the next significant economic event
Generation: Whether this is the original trade or a reentry (original, first reentry, second reentry)

3. Hybrid Identification System
The system creates a unified identification approach that bridges calendar events with matrix decisions. Each potential trading scenario gets a unique identifier that combines the economic calendar strategy ID with the matrix combination. This ensures that a reentry decision after a US employment report considers both the specific economic context and the trade outcome pattern.
4. Signal Enhancement and Integration
Economic calendar events generate multiple types of trading signals:

Main Event Signals: Generated when the economic event actually occurs
Anticipation Signals: Created 1 hour and 8 hours before major events
Country-Specific Signals: Separate signal types for different currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY)
Non-Calendar Signals: Market volatility spikes, equity market opens, and other technical indicators

5. Parameter Set Management
Rather than trying to manage thousands of individual parameter combinations, the system uses a hierarchical approach:

Base Templates: Conservative, moderate, aggressive risk profiles
Calendar Modifications: Adjustments specific to economic event timing and impact
Performance Overlays: Risk reduction measures based on recent trading performance
Matrix Mappings: Each unique combination maps to a specific parameter set

6. Risk-Adaptive Framework
The system continuously monitors trading performance and market conditions to adjust parameters:

Recent Performance Tracking: Monitors drawdowns over 4-hour and 12-hour periods
Streak Analysis: Counts consecutive wins and losses
Calendar Awareness: Considers proximity to upcoming economic events
Market Timing: Adjusts for market close proximity and volatility levels
Dynamic Adjustments: Automatically reduces position sizes, widens stops, or pauses trading based on risk assessment

7. Data Flow Architecture
The system operates across multiple platforms with clear data flow:

MT4 Expert Advisors: Execute trades and capture account/trade data
Excel Processing Engine: Performs all calculations, risk assessment, and parameter optimization
CSV Communication: Data flows between MT4 and Excel via CSV files
Real-Time Updates: Calendar events and market conditions update continuously

How It All Works Together
When a Trade Closes

Data Capture: MT4 EA records trade details (entry/exit prices, duration, outcome)
Context Assessment: Excel evaluates current market conditions, recent performance, and upcoming economic events
Matrix Lookup: The system determines which combination of factors applies to this situation
Parameter Selection: Based on the matrix position and current risk assessment, specific trading parameters are selected
Risk Adjustment: Parameters are modified based on recent performance and market conditions
Decision Export: Final parameters are sent back to MT4 for potential reentry execution

Economic Calendar Integration
Economic events create a dynamic overlay on the decision matrix. A trade that closes just before a major US employment report will be handled very differently than one closing during a quiet market period. The system recognizes that the same trade outcome (like hitting stop loss) requires different reentry approaches depending on the economic calendar context.
Risk Management Integration
The system continuously evaluates whether trading conditions warrant more conservative approaches. After experiencing drawdowns or consecutive losses, it automatically reduces position sizes, increases stop loss distances, and may temporarily halt trading entirely. This risk management operates independently of the matrix decisions but influences the final parameters.
Parameter Evolution
Rather than using static parameter sets, the system allows for gradual adjustment based on performance. Successful parameter combinations get reinforced, while consistently poor performers get modified. This creates a learning element where the system adapts to market conditions over time.
Key Benefits
Systematic Approach
Removes emotional decision-making from reentry situations by providing clear, rule-based responses to every combination of market conditions and trade outcomes.
Economic Calendar Awareness
Unlike basic reentry systems, this approach recognizes that market context matters. The same technical setup requires different treatment depending on economic calendar proximity.
Risk Focus
Capital preservation takes priority, especially after poor performance periods. The system automatically becomes more conservative when needed rather than continuing with aggressive parameters during drawdown periods.
Scalability
The framework can handle multiple currency pairs simultaneously, each with their own economic calendar considerations and performance tracking.
Flexibility
While systematic, the approach allows for manual overrides and parameter adjustments when market conditions warrant human intervention.
Current Implementation Status
The system architecture is well-designed with clear separation of concerns. The economic calendar processing and 5-digit strategy ID generation are functional. The multi-dimensional matrix concept is defined with proper identifier systems. The main remaining work involves implementing the actual decision engine logic, integrating the risk management calculations, and creating the communication bridges between components.
The foundation provides a robust framework for automated trading decisions that considers both technical trade outcomes and fundamental economic calendar context, while maintaining focus on capital preservation and risk management.RetryDWhat about the storage and database how are the matrix and reentry an individual unique identifier data stored maintain and recalledEditMapped intricate database architecture for matrix and identifier storageThe user is asking about the storage and database aspects of the system - how the matrix data, reentry decisions, and individual unique identifiers are stored, maintained, and recalled. This is an important architectural question that I haven't fully addressed in my previous responses.
Looking at the project knowledge and our conversation, I can see that:

We've designed identifier systems (5-digit strategy IDs, matrix combination IDs, hybrid IDs)
We've discussed the multi-dimensional matrix concept
We've talked about parameter sets and mappings
But we haven't fully detailed the storage architecture

From the project files, I can see there are some database schema references mentioned, particularly around SQLite usage for different components. Let me think through the storage requirements:
Data that needs to be stored:

Matrix combinations and their mappings to parameter sets
Economic calendar events and their strategy IDs
Trade execution results and performance tracking
Parameter sets and their configurations
Risk assessment data and historical performance
Audit trails and version history

Storage considerations:

Per-symbol storage (each currency pair needs its own matrix)
Version control and historical data
Performance for real-time lookups
Backup and recovery
Data integrity and relationships
Scalability across multiple symbols

Recall/Retrieval patterns:

Real-time matrix lookups during trade closes
Parameter set retrieval for execution
Performance analysis queries
Risk assessment calculations
Audit trail queries

I should provide a comprehensive overview of the storage architecture that addresses these needs while being practical for the Excel/MT4 implementation they're using.Data Storage and Database Architecture
Matrix and Reentry System Data Management
Storage Architecture Overview
The system requires multiple layers of data storage to handle the complexity of matrix combinations, economic calendar integration, and performance tracking. The architecture uses a hybrid approach combining SQLite databases for structured data with CSV files for MT4 communication.
Primary Storage Components
1. Symbol-Specific Matrix Storage
Each currency pair maintains its own complete dataset to avoid cross-contamination and enable independent optimization.
Per-Symbol Database Structure:

EURUSD_matrix.db
GBPUSD_matrix.db
USDJPY_matrix.db
etc.

Each symbol database contains identical table structures but completely separate data, allowing different parameter evolution for each currency pair.
2. Core Data Tables
Matrix Combinations Table
Stores every possible matrix combination with its unique identifier and current parameter set assignment.

Signal Types Generated: Which enhanced signals this event creates
Event Status: SCHEDULED, ACTIVE, EXPIRED, etc.

Unique Identifier Management
Combination ID Generation and Storage
The system generates deterministic identifiers ensuring the same inputs always produce identical IDs. These identifiers serve as primary keys linking matrix positions to parameter sets to execution results.
ID Composition Rules:

Calendar portion encodes economic context
Matrix portion encodes trade outcome and timing context
Combined ID provides complete situational context
Deterministic generation ensures consistency across system restarts

Parameter Set Versioning
Parameter sets use versioned identifiers allowing evolution without losing historical context. When parameters are modified, new versions are created while maintaining links to historical performance data.
Version Management:

Original parameter sets retain base version numbers
Modifications create incremented versions
Historical combinations maintain their original parameter set links
Performance tracking continues across versions with clear lineage

Data Maintenance Procedures
Matrix Population Process
When the system initializes or adds new combinations, it systematically populates the matrix using default assignment rules. This ensures every valid combination has an assigned parameter set before live trading begins.
Population Sequence:

Generate all valid calendar strategy IDs from economic events
Create all valid matrix combinations for each signal type
Apply default assignment rules based on outcome and proximity
Create audit entries documenting initial assignments
Validate that no combinations are left unmapped

Performance-Based Updates
The system continuously updates parameter assignments based on execution results. Combinations showing poor performance get reassigned to different parameter sets through an automated optimization process.
Update Triggers:

Minimum sample size reached for statistical significance
Performance falls below threshold levels
New parameter sets become available
Manual override by system operator
Periodic optimization cycles

Data Retention and Archival
Historical data is maintained for analysis and audit purposes but with retention policies to manage storage growth.
Retention Policies:

Trade execution data: Permanent retention
Matrix assignment history: Permanent retention
Economic calendar events: 2 years
Parameter set versions: Permanent (inactive versions archived)
Performance calculations: Permanent with periodic summarization

Data Retrieval Patterns
Real-Time Matrix Lookups
When a trade closes, the system must quickly determine the appropriate reentry parameters. This requires efficient lookup of the current matrix combination and its assigned parameter set.
Lookup Process:

Calculate matrix combination ID from trade close event
Query matrix combinations table for current parameter set assignment
Retrieve parameter set configuration from parameter sets table
Apply any real-time risk adjustments
Return final parameters for MT4 execution

Performance Analysis Queries
The system regularly analyzes performance across different matrix combinations and parameter sets to identify optimization opportunities.
Analysis Types:

Parameter set performance comparison across combinations
Matrix combination success rates by signal type
Calendar strategy ID effectiveness by country and impact
Risk-adjusted returns by generation (original vs reentry trades)
Temporal performance patterns by market session and calendar proximity

Audit Trail Reconstruction
Complete audit trails can be reconstructed showing why specific parameter sets were assigned to matrix combinations and how those assignments performed over time.
Audit Components:

Initial assignment reasoning and rule application
Performance-based reassignment decisions
Parameter set version changes and reasons
Override events and manual interventions
System configuration changes affecting assignments

Data Integrity and Backup
Referential Integrity
The database maintains strict relationships between tables ensuring data consistency and preventing orphaned records.
Key Relationships:

Every matrix combination must reference a valid parameter set
Every trade execution must reference a valid combination and parameter set
Every economic event must have a valid calendar strategy ID
Parameter set references must point to existing configurations

Backup and Recovery Strategy
Regular backups ensure system continuity and provide recovery options for data corruption or operational errors.
Backup Components:

Daily incremental backups of all symbol databases
Weekly full system backups including configuration files
Real-time replication of critical matrix assignment changes
Export capabilities for disaster recovery to alternate systems
Automated backup validation and integrity checking

This storage architecture provides the foundation for reliable operation of the integrated economic calendar reentry system while maintaining the flexibility needed for ongoing optimization and evolution.RetryDhow does the system handled changes in matrix variables. new indicators create a new signal typeEditEngineered flexible matrix system for new signal type integrationThe user is asking about how the system handles changes in matrix variables, specifically when new indicators create a new signal type. This is about the flexibility and extensibility of the matrix system they've been designing.
Looking at their system architecture, they have:

Signal types (currently 8): ECO_HIGH, ECO_MED, ANTICIPATION_1HR/8HR, EQUITY_OPEN_ASIA/EUROPE/USA, ALL_INDICATORS
These get enhanced with country specificity: ECO_HIGH_USD, ECO_HIGH_EUR, etc.
Matrix combinations that include generation, signal type, duration, outcome, proximity
Unique identifiers for each combination
Parameter sets mapped to combinations

The question is about what happens when they want to add new signal types - like if they develop a new technical indicator that creates its own signal type. This touches on:

Database schema changes
Matrix expansion (new combinations to generate)
Identifier system updates
Parameter set assignments for new combinations
Backward compatibility with existing data
Testing and validation of new signal types

This is a system design question about extensibility and change management. I should address:

How to add new signal types without breaking existing system
Database migration strategies
Matrix combination generation for new signals
Default parameter assignment for new combinations
Performance tracking initialization
Testing approaches
Rollback procedures
System Evolution and Matrix Variable Management
Handling New Signal Types and Matrix Changes
Change Management Philosophy
The system must balance stability with adaptability. Adding new signal types or modifying matrix dimensions requires careful orchestration to avoid disrupting live trading while enabling innovation and improvement.
New Signal Type Integration Process
1. Signal Type Registration
When a new indicator creates a signal type, it gets formally registered in the system before any matrix combinations are generated.
Registration Requirements:

Signal Type Name: Must follow naming convention (e.g., MOMENTUM_BREAKOUT_USD)
Signal Category: Technical, Fundamental, Hybrid, Custom
Trigger Conditions: What market conditions activate this signal
Duration Requirements: Whether this signal type uses duration categories
Country Specificity: Whether signal varies by currency
Priority Level: How this signal ranks against existing signals
Compatibility Rules: Which other signals it can coexist with

2. Matrix Dimension Impact Assessment
Before generating new combinations, the system calculates the scope of matrix expansion.
Impact Analysis:

Combination Count: How many new combinations will be created
Parameter Set Requirements: How many new parameter sets may be needed
Storage Impact: Database size increase estimates
Performance Impact: Processing time implications for lookups
Testing Requirements: Scope of validation needed before live deployment

3. Staged Rollout Approach
New signal types are introduced gradually rather than immediately generating all possible combinations.
Rollout Phases:

Phase 1: Signal type definition and basic combination generation
Phase 2: Default parameter assignment using conservative templates
Phase 3: Limited live testing with small position sizes
Phase 4: Performance validation and parameter optimization
Phase 5: Full integration with normal position sizing

Database Schema Evolution
Version-Based Schema Management
The database maintains version information enabling controlled schema evolution without data loss.
Schema Versioning:

Current schema version tracked in metadata table
Migration scripts handle transitions between versions
Backward compatibility maintained for at least two major versions
Rollback procedures available if new schema causes issues

Matrix Combination Expansion
When new signal types are added, the system generates new combinations systematically while preserving existing data.
Expansion Process:

Generate all valid combinations for new signal type
Apply default assignment rules to new combinations
Create audit entries documenting new combination creation
Validate that new combinations don't conflict with existing ones
Update combination count tracking for performance monitoring

Parameter Set Templates for New Signals
Rather than creating completely new parameter sets, new signal types initially inherit from existing templates with modifications.
Template Inheritance:

Technical signals inherit from ALL_INDICATORS template
Calendar-based signals inherit from appropriate ECO_* templates
Hybrid signals use weighted averages of multiple templates
Custom modifications applied based on signal characteristics
Performance tracking begins immediately with inherited parameters

Identifier System Adaptation
Maintaining ID Consistency
The unique identifier system must accommodate new signal types without breaking existing combinations.
ID Evolution Strategy:

Existing combination IDs remain unchanged
New signal types get assigned new identifier components
Calendar strategy IDs remain stable (5-digit system unchanged)
Matrix combination portion expands to accommodate new signals
Full hybrid IDs maintain backward compatibility

Signal Type Code Assignment
New signal types receive systematically assigned codes that avoid conflicts with existing signals.
Code Assignment Rules:

Technical indicators use TECH_* prefix with sequential numbering
Custom indicators use CUST_* prefix with user-defined suffixes
Hybrid signals use HYB_* prefix combining multiple signal characteristics
Reserved codes maintained for future expansion
Collision detection prevents duplicate assignments

Performance Tracking for New Signals
Initial Performance Baseline
New signal types begin with neutral performance assumptions until sufficient data accumulates.
Baseline Establishment:

Performance score starts at 50 (neutral on 0-100 scale)
Risk weighting begins conservatively regardless of signal strength
Sample size requirements defined before statistical significance
Comparison benchmarks established against similar existing signals
Performance tracking isolated initially to prevent contamination

Statistical Significance Requirements
New signal types must demonstrate meaningful performance before full integration.
Validation Criteria:

Minimum trade count (typically 30-50 executions)
Minimum time period (typically 30-60 days)
Statistical significance testing against random chance
Risk-adjusted performance comparison with existing signals
Stability testing across different market conditions

Configuration Management
Signal Type Configuration Files
Each signal type maintains its own configuration defining behavior and integration parameters.
Configuration Components:

Signal detection logic parameters
Matrix integration rules (duration requirements, proximity sensitivity)
Default parameter set assignments
Risk adjustment factors
Performance weighting in composite signals
Activation/deactivation controls for testing

Dynamic Signal Management
The system allows real-time activation and deactivation of signal types without system restart.
Runtime Management:

Signal types can be temporarily disabled during poor performance
New signals can be enabled gradually (limited symbols, reduced position sizes)
A/B testing supported for comparing signal variants
Emergency shutdown capabilities for problematic signals
Configuration changes logged for audit purposes

Testing and Validation Framework
Sandbox Environment
New signal types undergo extensive testing in isolated environments before live deployment.
Testing Phases:

Historical backtesting using past market data
Paper trading with real-time data but no actual positions
Limited live testing with minimal position sizes
Gradual scaling based on performance validation
Full integration after meeting all validation criteria

Performance Monitoring
Enhanced monitoring during new signal type introduction identifies issues quickly.
Monitoring Components:

Real-time performance tracking vs expectations
Risk metrics monitoring for unexpected behavior
Correlation analysis with existing signals
System performance impact measurement
User feedback collection and analysis

Rollback and Recovery Procedures
Safe Rollback Mechanisms
If new signal types cause problems, the system can safely revert to previous configurations.
Rollback Capabilities:

Signal type deactivation without affecting existing trades
Database rollback to pre-change state if necessary
Parameter set reversion to previous versions
Performance data preservation during rollbacks
Audit trail maintenance showing all changes and reversions

Gradual Deprecation
When signal types prove ineffective, they are gradually phased out rather than abruptly removed.
Deprecation Process:

Performance-based automatic deactivation triggers
Graceful handling of existing combinations using deprecated signals
Migration to replacement signals when available
Historical data preservation for analysis
Documentation of lessons learned for future signal development

This evolution framework ensures the matrix system remains stable and reliable while enabling continuous improvement through new signal types and enhanced trading logic.
