Short answer: Yes—it’s realistic to keep your CLI tools working exactly the same while swapping the visual shell to a Python GUI. Think of it like changing the steering wheel and dashboard while the engine (CLI tools) stays the same.Here’s how to do it cleanly.How to bring CLI into a Python GUI (without losing NL control)1) Keep the CLI as-is; add a thin “adapter”
    •    What stays the same: your CLI binaries/commands, flags, output formats, exit codes.
    •    What you add: a tiny Python layer that runs those commands and streams their stdout/stderr back to the GUI.Options to run CLIs from Python
    •    subprocess + async pipes (good default; reliable cross-platform)
    •    pexpect / ptyprocess (when a tool is interactive / expects a TTY)
    •    On Windows, for true TTY behavior use pywinpty; on Unix use a PTY (pseudo-terminal)2) Preserve the natural-language UXExactly what you do in VS Code can be mirrored:NL → Command Planner
    •    A small “planner” translates user text into a structured command request:
    •    { tool: "semgrep", args: ["--config", "auto", "."], cwd: "/repo" }
    •    The same planner can be shared by both UIs (VS Code extension and Python app) if you keep it as a small service or library.
    •    Show a preview: “I’m going to run: semgrep --config auto . (Run / Edit)”.Chat-style control
    •    Left pane: chat box for natural language
    •    Right pane: “planned command” card + terminal stream
    •    Buttons: Dry Run, Run, Cancel, Kill3) Make the GUI feel like a terminal + cockpit
    •    Terminal panel (read-only or interactive): live output, colors, hyperlinks
    •    Command Library: same saved recipes you use in VS Code
    •    Quick Actions: Run Validation, Generate Patch, Replay, etc.
    •    Progress bars: tail output for % (or parse known CLI progress lines)
    •    Artifacts: show produced files, logs, JSON reports4) Keep parity with VS Code using a shared “command contract”Define a tiny JSON schema your planner emits and your runner consumes. Both UIs use it.{
  "tool": "ruff",
  "args": ["--fix", "."],
  "env": {"PYTHONWARNINGS": "ignore"},
  "cwd": "/repo",
  "timeout_sec": 600,
  "interactive": false
}    •    In VS Code: extension sends this to its runner.
    •    In Python GUI: same JSON goes to a Python runner class.
    •    Result object mirrors exit code, stdout, stderr, artifacts.5) Architecture patterns (pick one)A. All-in-one desktop app (simple)
    •    PyQt6/Qt (UI)
    •    Python runner (spawns CLIs via asyncio.create_subprocess_exec)
    •    Pros: easy, offline; Cons: you bundle everythingB. Client–server (scales better)
    •    FastAPI or small gRPC/WS server runs the CLIs
    •    Python GUI talks over WebSocket/HTTP (same API your VS Code extension can also use)
    •    Pros: one backend, two frontends (VS Code + GUI) share logic; Cons: one more moving part6) Realistic? Yes. Here’s what to watch out forCross-platform quirks
    •    PATH/env differences between shells (PowerShell vs bash) — normalize env
    •    Encoding (UTF-8) and ANSI colors — pass LANG/PYTHONIOENCODING properly
    •    Long-running processes — add Cancel/Kill and timeoutsInteractive CLIs
    •    If a tool prompts (y/N, passwords), either:
    •    Run it in a PTY with pexpect and surface the prompt in the GUI, or
    •    Run with --yes/non-interactive flags, or
    •    Pre-fill inputs via stdinOutput parsing
    •    Prefer machine-readable flags (--json, --sarif) where available
    •    Fall back to regex/line markers for progress & statusesSecurity & safety
    •    RBAC/approvals for destructive commands
    •    Sandboxed working directories
    •    “Dry-run” mode that shows the exact command before execution7) What the Python GUI would look like (mentally picture it)
    •    Chat box: “Run a full validation and patch anything fixable.”
    •    Planner card: shows ruff --fix ., pytest -q, semgrep --config auto .
    •    Terminal stream: live output from each command, tabs per step
    •    Progress: 3/5 steps done (60%), ETA 2m
    •    Artifacts: report.json, patch.diff with “Open / Save” buttons8) Migration checklist (keep it frictionless)
    1.    Extract your NL→Command planner into a shared module/service.
    2.    Define the command contract JSON (request/response).
    3.    Build a small Python runner that accepts that contract and spawns CLIs.
    4.    Add a terminal widget + preview → run UX.
    5.    Add Quick Actions and Command Library backed by the same recipes you use in VS Code.⸻Bottom line: Absolutely realistic. You keep the exact same CLI behavior and natural-language control; only the visual shell changes. Use a shared command contract and you’ll have parity between VS Code and the Python GUI—today and later if you add more frontends.EditThis is an excellent architectural approach! You've outlined a clean separation of concerns that preserves your existing CLI investments while building a more sophisticated interface.
The key insight here is treating the CLI tools as a stable API layer while building abstraction layers above them. Your "command contract" JSON schema is particularly smart - it creates a universal interface that any frontend can consume.
A few additional thoughts on your approach:
For the shared planner service, consider making it pluggable so you can experiment with different NL→command strategies (rule-based, LLM-powered, hybrid) without touching the runner or UI layers.
On the client-server vs all-in-one decision, the client-server approach pays dividends if you ever want to run heavy CLI tools on remote machines or share a backend between team members. But all-in-one is definitely simpler to start.
For terminal integration, you might want to preserve shell features users expect - command history, tab completion for file paths, and the ability to drop into a raw shell when needed. The readonly terminal with occasional "open real terminal here" escape hatch works well.
One pattern worth considering: Make your GUI capable of "recording" manual CLI sessions and converting them into reusable recipes. So users can drop to terminal, figure out a complex command sequence, then promote it to a saved workflow.
The migration path you've outlined is very sensible - start with the shared planner, validate the command contract works for your existing workflows, then build the GUI incrementally. This approach minimizes risk while letting you validate each layer.
Have you thought about how you'll handle CLI tools that have complex interactive flows or ones that spawn their own subprocesses?RetryDHow should I approach:CLI tools that have complex interactive flows or ones that spawn their own subprocessesEditSearched project for “CLI tools interactive flows subprocesses PTY terminal handling pexpect”6 resultsENTERPRISE_INTEGRATION_PLAN.mdtextsrc/cli_multi_rapid/cli.py2 relevant sectionstextdocs/ai-tools-guide.md2 relevant sectionstextdocs/archive/cli workflow.txttextscripts/workflow_interface.ps1textscripts/run_workflow.ps1textGreat question! CLI tools with complex interactive flows and subprocess spawning require special handling. Here's how to tackle each scenario:
Interactive CLI Tools
Problem: Tools that prompt for user input, show menus, or require Y/N confirmations.
Solutions:
1. PTY (Pseudo-Terminal) Approach
pythonimport pexpect
import asyncio

async def handle_interactive_cli(command, responses={}):
    """
    Handle interactive CLI with pexpect
    responses: dict mapping expected prompts to responses
    """
    process = pexpect.spawn(command, timeout=30)
    
    # Set up logging of all interactions
    process.logfile = open('cli_session.log', 'wb')
    
    try:
        for prompt, response in responses.items():
            process.expect(prompt)
            process.sendline(response)
        
        # Wait for completion
        process.expect(pexpect.EOF)
        return process.before.decode()
        
    except pexpect.TIMEOUT:
        # Surface timeout to GUI for user intervention
        return {"status": "needs_input", "prompt": process.before.decode()}
2. Non-Interactive Modes First
Most CLI tools have flags to bypass interactivity:
pythonINTERACTIVE_OVERRIDES = {
    "git": ["--no-edit", "-y"],
    "npm": ["--yes", "--silent"],
    "terraform": ["-auto-approve", "-input=false"],
    "docker": ["--rm", "--no-input"]
}

def make_non_interactive(tool, args):
    if tool in INTERACTIVE_OVERRIDES:
        return args + INTERACTIVE_OVERRIDES[tool]
    return args
3. GUI Prompt Injection
When a tool needs input, surface it in your GUI:
pythonclass InteractiveHandler:
    def __init__(self, gui_callback):
        self.gui_callback = gui_callback
        
    async def handle_prompt(self, process, prompt_text):
        # Show prompt in GUI
        user_input = await self.gui_callback({
            "type": "user_input",
            "prompt": prompt_text,
            "timeout": 60
        })
        
        process.sendline(user_input)
Complex Subprocess Trees
Problem: Tools that spawn child processes, background jobs, or long-running services.
Solutions:
1. Process Group Management
pythonimport subprocess
import os
import signal

class ProcessTreeManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.process_groups = {}
        
    def start_with_tree_tracking(self, cmd, job_id):
        # Start in new process group
        process = subprocess.Popen(
            cmd,
            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
            stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
            preexec_fn=os.setsid,  # Create new process group
            text=True
        )
        
        self.process_groups[job_id] = process.pid
        return process
        
    def kill_tree(self, job_id):
        if job_id in self.process_groups:
            # Kill entire process group
            os.killpg(self.process_groups[job_id], signal.SIGTERM)
2. Subprocess Detection & Monitoring
pythonimport psutil

def monitor_process_tree(parent_pid):
    """Monitor all children of a process"""
    try:
        parent = psutil.Process(parent_pid)
        children = parent.children(recursive=True)
        
        return {
            "parent": {"pid": parent.pid, "status": parent.status()},
            "children": [
                {"pid": child.pid, "name": child.name(), "status": child.status()}
                for child in children
            ]
        }
    except psutil.NoSuchProcess:
        return {"status": "completed"}
3. Docker/Container Isolation
For really complex tools, consider containerizing:
pythonasync def run_in_container(tool_config):
    """Run complex CLI tools in isolated containers"""
    docker_cmd = [
        "docker", "run", "--rm", 
        "-v", f"{os.getcwd()}:/workspace",
        "-w", "/workspace",
        tool_config["image"],
        *tool_config["command"]
    ]
    
    # Container provides clean process isolation
    return await asyncio.create_subprocess_exec(*docker_cmd)
Specific Patterns for Your Architecture
1. Extended Command Contract
Add fields to handle complexity:
json{
  "tool": "terraform",
  "args": ["apply"],
  "interactive": true,
  "expected_prompts": {
    "Do you want to perform these actions?": "yes",
    "Enter a value:": "production"
  },
  "subprocess_policy": "track_tree",
  "timeout_sec": 1800,
  "container_image": "hashicorp/terraform:latest"
}
2. State Machine for Complex Flows
pythonclass CLIFlowState:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = "starting"
        self.substeps = []
        self.user_inputs_needed = []
        
    async def advance(self, process_output):
        if "Please confirm" in process_output:
            self.state = "waiting_for_confirmation"
            return {"action": "prompt_user", "message": process_output}
            
        elif "spawning background job" in process_output:
            self.state = "monitoring_children"
            return {"action": "track_subprocesses"}
3. GUI Controls for Complex Cases
In your Python GUI, add:

Interrupt/Resume buttons for long-running tools
Input dialogs that pop up when CLI needs input
Process tree viewer showing parent/child relationships
Background job panel for monitoring spawned processes
Manual override mode - drop to real terminal when needed

4. Fallback to Real Terminal
Sometimes the best approach is knowing when to bail out:
pythondef should_use_real_terminal(tool, args):
    """Some tools are too complex for automation"""
    complex_patterns = [
        (tool == "vim" and "--batch" not in args),
        (tool == "emacs" and "--batch" not in args),
        (tool == "interactive-installer" and "--silent" not in args)
    ]
    return any(complex_patterns)

# In your GUI:
if should_use_real_terminal(command.tool, command.args):
    return {"action": "open_terminal", "command": command.full_command}
The key is building a hierarchy: try non-interactive first, handle common interactive patterns automatically, surface complex cases to the user gracefully, and provide an escape hatch to real terminals when needed.RetryDAnalyze repo for vs code interface functionality and describe in detail what a python gui would need to match that functionalityEditSearched project for “VS Code interface functionality tasks.json workflows python GUI requirements”6 resultsdocs/specs/Phase_Plan.integrated.mdtextCODEX_IMPLEMENTATION/integration_specs/vscode_workflow_integration.md2 relevant sectionstextVSCODE_SETUP.mdtext.vscode/tasks.jsontextREADME.mdtextCODEX_IMPLEMENTATION/vscode_configuration/README_VSCODE_SETUP.md2 relevant sectionstextSearched project for “tasks.json launch.json VS Code debug configurations CLI terminal interface”4 resultsVSCODE_SETUP.md2 relevant sectionstext.vscode/tasks.json3 relevant sectionstextCODEX_IMPLEMENTATION/integration_specs/vscode_workflow_integration.md2 relevant sectionstextscripts/launchers/Launch-Menu.ps1textSearched project for “Python GUI requirements terminal integration file explorer debugging”8 resultsVSCODE_INTEGRATION.mdtextCODEX_IMPLEMENTATION/vscode_configuration/README_VSCODE_SETUP.mdtextVSCODE_SETUP.mdtextCODEX_IMPLEMENTATION/vscode_configuration/settings.jsontextscripts/INS_path_a_migration_guide.mdtextCODEX_IMPLEMENTATION/integration_specs/vscode_workflow_integration.mdtextCODEX_IMPLEMENTATION/README_CODEX_INSTRUCTIONS.mdtextThe Complete Guide to Agentic Development with Claude Code.mdtextBased on my analysis of the repository's VS Code interface functionality, here's a detailed breakdown of what a Python GUI would need to match that functionality:
Python GUI Requirements to Match VS Code Interface Functionality
Core Interface Components
1. Task Management System
The VS Code setup includes 22+ predefined tasks accessible via Command Palette. The Python GUI needs:
Task Panel/Menu System

CLI Multi-Rapid Platform Tasks (7 tasks): Test commands, workflow status, compliance reporting
Development Tasks (8 tasks): Setup, testing, formatting, linting, security scanning
Legacy Agent Tasks (3 tasks): Agent runs, audit monitoring

    def create_terminal(self, profile_name="default"):
        # Create new terminal with profile settings
        pass
    
    async def execute_command(self, command, terminal_id):
        # Execute command with async subprocess
        pass
4. File Explorer and Project Management

        self.commands = self.load_all_commands()
    
    def filter_commands(self, search_text):
        # Fuzzy search through available commands
        pass
    
    def execute_selected_command(self):
        # Execute the selected command/task
        pass
Advanced Features to Match VS Code

    def __init__(self):
        self.problems = []
        self.severity_levels = ["Error", "Warning", "Info"]
    
    def add_problem(self, file_path, line, column, message, severity):
        pass
    
    def clear_problems_for_file(self, file_path):
        pass
    
    def navigate_to_problem(self, problem_id):
        # Jump to file location
        pass
9. Extension System
VS Code's extension recommendations equivalent:

                    "charliermarsh.ruff"
                ]
            }
        }
Implementation Architecture
Core GUI Framework Requirements
python# Main application structure
class CLIMultiRapidGUI(QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        
        # Core panels
        self.file_explorer = FileExplorer()
        self.terminal_manager = TerminalManager() 
        self.task_manager = TaskManager()

        self.setup_menu_bar()
        self.setup_status_bar()
        
    def setup_dockable_panels(self):
        # Create dockable windows like VS Code
        pass
Key Technical Requirements

Async Process Management: Handle long-running CLI processes without blocking UI
Real-time Output Streaming: Display command output as it happens
Syntax Highlighting: Code editor with language support
Theme System: Dark/light themes matching VS Code
Keyboard Shortcuts: Configurable hotkeys for all actions
Session Persistence: Remember window layout, open files, terminal states

Integration Points
The Python GUI must integrate with the same systems VS Code uses:

Cross-Language Bridge: Python↔MQL4↔PowerShell communication
Workflow Orchestrator: 13-phase implementation framework
Recovery System: Automated error handling and healing
Compliance System: Security scanning and validation
Git Integration: Status, diff viewing, branch management

This comprehensive GUI would essentially recreate VS Code's development environment as a native Python application, maintaining all the workflow capabilities while providing the flexibility of a custom interface.RetryDThe goal is to put the interface cli tool interface in the gui and keep all other functionality of the cli tools the same. Basically a command prompt terminal running in a python gui. Does that make sense?EditAh yes, that makes much more sense! You want to create a terminal emulator GUI - essentially a command prompt window running inside a Python application. Much simpler than recreating VS Code's entire interface.
Here's what you need for a terminal-in-GUI approach:
Core Requirements
1. Terminal Emulator Widget
pythonimport subprocess
import asyncio
from PyQt6.QtWidgets import QTextEdit, QLineEdit, QVBoxLayout
from PyQt6.QtCore import QThread, pyqtSignal
from PyQt6.QtGui import QFont

class TerminalWidget(QTextEdit):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.setup_terminal_appearance()
        self.command_history = []
        self.history_index = -1
        
    def setup_terminal_appearance(self):
        # Make it look like a real terminal
        font = QFont("Consolas", 10)  # or "Courier New"
        self.setFont(font)
        self.setStyleSheet("""
            QTextEdit {
                background-color: #1e1e1e;
                color: #ffffff;
                border: none;
            }
        """)
2. Command Input Handler
pythonclass CommandInput(QLineEdit):
    command_entered = pyqtSignal(str)
    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.command_history = []
        self.history_index = -1
        
    def keyPressEvent(self, event):
        if event.key() == Qt.Key.Key_Return:
            command = self.text()
            self.command_entered.emit(command)
            self.add_to_history(command)
            self.clear()
        elif event.key() == Qt.Key.Key_Up:
            self.navigate_history(-1)
        elif event.key() == Qt.Key.Key_Down:
            self.navigate_history(1)
        else:
            super().keyPressEvent(event)
3. Process Executor (The Key Part)
pythonclass CLIExecutor(QThread):
    output_ready = pyqtSignal(str)
    error_ready = pyqtSignal(str)
    finished = pyqtSignal(int)
    
    def __init__(self, command):
        super().__init__()
        self.command = command
        self.process = None
        
    def run(self):
        try:
            # This keeps your CLI tools exactly as they are
            self.process = subprocess.Popen(
                self.command,
                shell=True,
                stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
                stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
                text=True,
                bufsize=1,
                universal_newlines=True
            )
            
            # Stream output in real-time
            for line in iter(self.process.stdout.readline, ''):
                if line:
                    self.output_ready.emit(line.rstrip())
                    
            self.process.wait()
            self.finished.emit(self.process.returncode)
            
        except Exception as e:
            self.error_ready.emit(f"Error: {str(e)}")
4. Main Terminal GUI
pythonclass TerminalGUI(QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.setWindowTitle("CLI Multi-Rapid Terminal")
        
        # Terminal display
        self.terminal_output = TerminalWidget()
        self.command_input = CommandInput()
        
        # Layout
        central_widget = QWidget()
        layout = QVBoxLayout()
        layout.addWidget(self.terminal_output)
        layout.addWidget(self.command_input)
        central_widget.setLayout(layout)
        self.setCentralWidget(central_widget)
        
        # Connect signals
        self.command_input.command_entered.connect(self.execute_command)
        
        # Show initial prompt
        self.show_prompt()
        
    def show_prompt(self):
        import os
        cwd = os.getcwd()
        prompt = f"{cwd}> "
        self.terminal_output.append(prompt)
        
    def execute_command(self, command):
        # Display the command
        self.terminal_output.append(command)
        
        # Execute it (your CLI tools run unchanged)
        self.executor = CLIExecutor(command)
        self.executor.output_ready.connect(self.append_output)
        self.executor.error_ready.connect(self.append_error)
        self.executor.finished.connect(self.command_finished)
        self.executor.start()
        
    def append_output(self, text):
        self.terminal_output.append(text)
        
    def append_error(self, text):
        self.terminal_output.append(f"<span style='color: red;'>{text}</span>")
        
    def command_finished(self, return_code):
        self.show_prompt()
What This Achieves
✅ Keeps CLI Tools Unchanged

Your existing CLI commands work exactly as they do now
python -m cli_multi_rapid.cli greet Alice runs identically
All flags, arguments, output formatting preserved
No changes needed to your CLI codebase

✅ Simple Integration

Just wraps the terminal in a GUI window
Uses subprocess to run commands exactly as if typed in cmd.exe
Streams output in real-time
Handles both stdout and stderr

✅ Enhanced UX Without Complexity

Command history (up/down arrows)
Copy/paste support
Resizable window
Syntax highlighting for output (optional)
Multiple tabs for different sessions (optional)

Optional Enhancements
Quick Command Buttons
python# Add toolbar with common commands
def add_quick_commands(self):
    toolbar = QToolBar()
    
    # Common CLI commands as buttons
    help_btn = toolbar.addAction("Help")
    help_btn.triggered.connect(lambda: self.execute_command("cli-multi-rapid --help"))
    
    status_btn = toolbar.addAction("Status")  
    status_btn.triggered.connect(lambda: self.execute_command("cli-multi-rapid phase stream list"))
    
    self.addToolBar(toolbar)
Working Directory Display
pythondef update_prompt(self):
    cwd = os.getcwd()
    self.setWindowTitle(f"CLI Multi-Rapid Terminal - {cwd}")
ANSI Color Support
python# For colored output from your CLI tools
def parse_ansi_colors(self, text):
    # Convert ANSI escape codes to HTML colors
    # Libraries like 'colorama' can help here
    pass
Benefits of This Approach

Zero CLI Changes: Your existing tools work unchanged
Familiar Interface: Still feels like a command prompt
Enhanced Features: GUI niceties without losing CLI power
Easy Migration: Users can still use regular terminal if preferred
Simple Maintenance: No complex UI state management

This gives you the "cockpit" feel you mentioned while keeping your CLI tools as the stable API layer underneath. The GUI is just a nicer window for the same commands you already have.RetryDWe need to design the visual interface and how to remove the vs code option and replace it with the python GUI.

Now I can see exactly what you have. Let's design a migration plan from VS Code to a Python GUI terminal interface.
Visual Interface Design & Migration Plan
Current VS Code Interface Analysis
Based on your repository, you currently have:

22+ VS Code tasks in .vscode/tasks.json
12+ debug configurations in .vscode/launch.json
Launch-Menu.ps1 that offers interface choice (VS Code vs Terminal)
Comprehensive task categories: CLI Platform, Development, Git/Monitoring, etc.

Quick Action Buttons
Transform your VS Code tasks into clickable buttons:
python# Convert VS Code tasks to GUI buttons
VS_CODE_TASKS = {
    "CLI Platform": [
        ("Test Commands", "python -m src.cli_multi_rapid.cli --help"),
        ("Workflow Status", "python -m src.cli_multi_rapid.cli workflow-status"),
        ("Compliance Report", "python -m src.cli_multi_rapid.cli compliance report"),
    ],
    "Workflow": [
        ("List Streams", "cli-multi-rapid phase stream list"),
        ("Run Stream A", "cli-multi-rapid phase stream run stream-a --dry"),
        ("Execute Phase", "python -m workflows.orchestrator run-phase phase1"),
    ],
    "Development": [
        ("Run Tests", "pytest tests/ -v --cov=src"),
        ("Format Code", "black src/ tests/ && isort src/ tests/"),

Write-Host "  CLI Multi-Rapid GUI IMigration Approach Summary
Here's your complete migration plan from VS Code to Python GUI:
Phase 1: Preparation (5 minutes)

Run analysis: python scripts/migrate_vscode_to_gui.py --dry-run

See what will be migrated without changing anything
Review the 22+ tasks that will become GUI buttons



Phase 2: Setup GUI (10 minutes)

Run setup script: .\Setup-GUI-Interface.ps1

Installs PyQt6 dependencies
Creates GUI directory structure
Backs up your VS Code configuration
Updates launch mechanisms



Phase 3: Migration (2 minutes)

Copy the GUI code: Save the cli_terminal_gui.py artifact to gui/cli_terminal_gui.py
Test the interface: python gui/cli_terminal_gui.py

Phase 4: Update Launch Points (3 minutes)
Your current launch system will be updated:
Before (VS Code focused):
Launch-Menu.ps1 choices:
1. Open in VS Code ← Primary option
2. Command Line Interface  
3. Quick system test
4. Exit
After (GUI focused):
Launch-Menu.ps1 choices:
1. Python GUI Terminal ← New primary option
2. Command Line Interface
3. Restore VS Code Interface ← Fallback option
4. Quick system test
5. Exit
What Gets Migrated:
Your 22+ VS Code tasks become clickable buttons organized by category:
VS Code TaskGUI Button LocationCLI: Test Enhanced CommandsCLI Platform → "📋 Help"CLI: Workflow StatusCLI Platform → "📊 Status"Workflow: Execute PhaseWorkflows → "🔧 Execute Phase"Test: Run All TestsDevelopment → "🧪 Run Tests"Lint: Format CodeDevelopment → "🎨 Format Code"
Key Benefits:
✅ Zero CLI Changes: All your existing CLI commands work identically
✅ Better Terminal: Real terminal emulator with colors, history, copy/paste
✅ Quick Actions: One-click access to all your VS Code tasks
✅ Reversible: Complete VS Code backup for easy restoration
✅ Enhanced UX: Status bar, progress indicators, better error handling
Rollback Plan:
If you want to go back to VS Code:

Via GUI: Choose option 3 in Launch-Menu.ps1
Manually: Copy-Item .vscode_backup .vscode -Recurse -Force
Script: python scripts/restore_vscode.py
