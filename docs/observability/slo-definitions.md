## SLO Monitoring Implementation

### Recording Rules
All SLOs are calculated using Prometheus recording rules:

```yaml
# Example: System Availability SLO
- record: slo:system_availability:rate5m
  expr: |
    (
      sum(rate(up{job=~"data-ingestor|indicator-engine|signal-generator|risk-manager|execution-engine"}[5m])) 
      / 
      count(up{job=~"data-ingestor|indicator-engine|signal-generator|risk-manager|execution-engine"})
    )
```

### Alerting Rules
Each SLO has corresponding alerting rules:

```yaml
# Example: System Availability Alert
- alert: SystemAvailabilitySLOViolation
  expr: slo:system_availability:rate5m < 0.999
  for: 1m
  labels:
    severity: critical
    slo: system_availability
```

### Dashboards
Grafana dashboards provide real-time SLO monitoring:

- **Trading System Overview**: High-level SLO status
- **SLO Detail View**: Detailed metrics and trends  
- **SLO Burn Rate**: Error budget consumption tracking
- **Business Impact**: Trading-specific KPIs

## Error Budget Management

### Error Budget Calculation
Error Budget = (1 - SLO Target) × Measurement Window

Example for 99.9% availability over 12-hour trading day:
- Error Budget = (1 - 0.999) × 43,200 seconds = 43.2 seconds

### Burn Rate Alerts
- **Fast Burn**: 2% of monthly budget consumed in 1 hour → Page immediately
- **Slow Burn**: 10% of monthly budget consumed in 24 hours → Alert team

### Error Budget Policy
- **Budget Remaining > 50%**: Normal operations, focus on feature development
- **Budget Remaining 10-50%**: Prioritize reliability improvements
- **Budget Remaining < 10%**: Feature freeze, focus on reliability only
- **Budget Exhausted**: Emergency response, immediate reliability focus
