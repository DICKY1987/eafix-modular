# OpenSSF Scorecards Security Policy

## Overview

This document defines the security policy and minimum requirements for the EAFIX Trading System based on OpenSSF Scorecards supply chain security assessment framework.

## Policy Statement

**The EAFIX trading system MUST maintain a minimum OpenSSF Scorecard score of 7.0/10 with no more than 5 high-priority security findings to ensure adequate supply chain security for financial trading operations.**

## Rationale

### Trading System Context
- **Financial Exposure**: Direct market access with real monetary risk
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Must meet financial industry security standards (SOX, PCI DSS)  
- **Operational Criticality**: 99.9% uptime SLO during market hours (6 AM - 6 PM EST)
- **Data Sensitivity**: Trade signals, positions, and P&L data require highest protection
- **Supply Chain Risk**: Dependencies could introduce vulnerabilities affecting trading logic

### Security Framework Benefits
- **Standardized Assessment**: Industry-recognized security evaluation framework
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Weekly automated security posture assessment
- **Compliance Evidence**: Auditable security controls for regulatory review
- **Risk Reduction**: Proactive identification of supply chain vulnerabilities
