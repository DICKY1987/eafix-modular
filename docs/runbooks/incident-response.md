# Incident Response Runbook

## üö® Emergency Response Overview

This runbook provides the primary incident response procedures for the EAFIX trading system. Follow these procedures for any system incident that impacts trading operations or system availability.

## üìû Immediate Actions (0-5 minutes)

### 1. Alert Acknowledgment
```bash
# Acknowledge PagerDuty alert
# - Log into PagerDuty dashboard
# - Acknowledge the incident
# - Set status to "Investigating"
```

### 2. Initial Assessment
**Questions to answer immediately:**
- Is trading currently active? (Check market hours)
- Are positions at risk? (Check open positions)
- Is data flowing? (Check recent price updates)
- Are orders executing? (Check recent order activity)

### 3. Safety Measures
```bash
# If trading must be stopped immediately
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/emergency/stop-trading

# If specific service must be isolated
docker compose stop <service-name>

# Check system status
make smoke
```

## üîç Triage Phase (5-15 minutes)

### Incident Classification
Classify incident severity:

**P0 - Critical** (Page immediately, all hands)
- Complete system outage during market hours
- Data corruption affecting positions
- Security breach with active exploitation
- Risk management system failure

**P1 - High** (Page immediately, dev team)
- Partial system outage affecting trading
- Significant latency increase (>5s for signals)
- Position reconciliation failure
- Market data feed interruption

**P2 - Medium** (Page during business hours)
- Individual service outage (non-critical path)
- Performance degradation (<5s latency)
- Data quality issues
- Monitoring system issues

**P3 - Low** (Handle during business hours)
- Minor feature issues
- Cosmetic problems
- Documentation issues

### Initial Diagnosis
```bash
# 1. Check service health status
curl http://localhost:8080/health | jq .

# 2. Check Docker container status
docker compose ps

# 3. Check recent logs for errors
docker compose logs --tail=100 --since=15m | grep -i error

# 4. Check system resources
docker stats --no-stream

# 5. Check database connectivity
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U eafix -d eafix_prod -c "SELECT now();"

# 6. Check Redis connectivity
redis-cli ping
```

### Immediate Containment
Based on initial findings:

**Service Failure:**
```bash
# Restart specific service
docker compose restart <service-name>

# Check service logs
docker compose logs <service-name> --tail=50
```

**Database Issues:**
```bash
# Check database connections
psql -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;"

# Check database size and locks
psql -c "SELECT * FROM pg_locks WHERE NOT granted;"
```

**Network/Connectivity:**
```bash
# Test internal connectivity
docker exec <container> ping <target-container>

# Check external connectivity
curl -I https://api.external-broker.com/
```

## üìä Investigation Phase (15-60 minutes)

### Data Collection
```bash
# 1. Collect system snapshots
docker compose logs --since=1h > incident_logs_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt

# 2. Export metrics (if Prometheus available)
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query_range?query=up&start=$(date -d '1 hour ago' -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)&end=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)&step=60s

# 3. Database performance snapshot
psql -c "\x" -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY total_time DESC LIMIT 10;"

# 4. Check recent deployments
git log --oneline --since="24 hours ago"
```

### Trading Impact Assessment
```bash
# Check recent trading activity
curl http://localhost:8080/api/positions | jq '.[] | select(.status == "open")'

# Check recent signals
curl http://localhost:8083/api/signals?since=1h

# Check recent executions
curl http://localhost:8085/api/executions?since=1h

# Verify position reconciliation
curl http://localhost:8080/api/reconcile/positions
```

### Root Cause Analysis
Follow these investigation paths:

**Performance Issues:**
1. Check resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk)
2. Analyze slow queries in database
3. Review message queue depths
4. Check network latency between services

**Data Issues:**
1. Validate data integrity with checksums
2. Check for missing or delayed market data
3. Verify contract schema compliance
4. Review data transformation pipelines

**Service Failures:**
1. Analyze service logs for exceptions
2. Check dependency health
3. Review configuration changes
4. Validate service discovery

## üõ†Ô∏è Resolution Phase (60+ minutes)

### Temporary Fixes
Priority order for temporary fixes:
1. **Stop losses** - Prevent further damage
2. **Service restart** - Quick recovery attempt  
3. **Traffic routing** - Bypass failed components
4. **Rollback** - Return to known good state
5. **Manual intervention** - Execute critical functions manually

### Permanent Fixes
```bash
# 1. Code fix deployment
git checkout hotfix/incident-fix
make docker-build
make docker-up

# 2. Configuration changes
# Update environment variables
# Restart affected services
docker compose restart <service-name>

# 3. Infrastructure changes
# Scale services if needed
docker compose up -d --scale <service>=3

# 4. Data repair (if needed)
# Run data integrity scripts
python scripts/data-repair/fix_positions.py --dry-run
```

### Validation
```bash
# 1. Smoke test all critical paths
make smoke

# 2. Contract validation
make contracts-validate-full

# 3. Trading flow test
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/test/simulate-tick
sleep 2
curl http://localhost:8083/api/signals?limit=1

# 4. Performance test
python scripts/performance/latency-test.py --duration=300
```
