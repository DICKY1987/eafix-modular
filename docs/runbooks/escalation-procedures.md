```

#### 3. Escalation Decision
```bash
# Automatic escalation triggers:
if [ "$RESPONSE_TIME" -gt "$SLA_THRESHOLD" ]; then
    escalate_to_secondary
fi

# Manual escalation criteria:
if [ "$SEVERITY" == "P0" ] || [ "$COMPLEXITY" == "HIGH" ]; then
    escalate_to_secondary
fi
```

#### 4. Secondary Response
```bash
# Take ownership or provide support
- Review incident timeline
- Deep dive technical investigation
- Coordinate with primary on-call
- Make escalation decisions

# Update communication:
echo "🔧 Secondary engineer engaged: @secondary-oncall
