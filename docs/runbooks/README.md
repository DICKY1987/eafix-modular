# Redis connectivity
redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379 ping

# Message bus status
redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379 info replication
```

### Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Service response times
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -o /dev/null -s http://localhost:8080/healthz

# Resource usage
docker stats

# Database performance
psql -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';"
```

### Log Analysis
```bash
# Search for errors in last hour
docker compose logs --since=1h | grep -i error

# Trading-specific logs
docker compose logs signal-generator --since=30m | grep -i "signal"

# Performance logs
docker compose logs --since=1h | grep -E "(slow|timeout|latency)"
```
