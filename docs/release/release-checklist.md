## Release Process

### 1. Version Planning
```bash
# Determine version number using semantic versioning
# Format: vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
# Example: v0.1.0 (first production release)

# Create release branch
git checkout -b release/v0.1.0
```

### 2. Pre-Release Preparation
```bash
# Run full test suite
make test-all

# Validate contracts
make contracts-validate-full

# Security scan
make security-scan

# Update version in files
./scripts/update-version.sh 0.1.0
```

### 3. Release Automation
The release process is automated via GitHub Actions when a tag is pushed:

```bash
# Create and push release tag
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0

# This triggers:
# 1. Security validation (Scorecards, vulnerability scanning)
# 2. Integration testing (full stack deployment test)
# 3. Container image building and signing
# 4. SBOM generation
# 5. GitHub release creation with comprehensive notes
# 6. Deployment artifact creation
```

### 4. Manual Release (if needed)
```bash
# Trigger manual release via GitHub Actions
gh workflow run release.yml -f version=v0.1.0 -f pre_release=false
```

## Post-Release Activities

### 1. Deployment Verification
```bash
# Verify release artifacts
curl -O https://github.com/DICKY1987/eafix-modular/releases/download/v0.1.0/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh

# Test deployment
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/system/status
```

### 2. Monitoring & Metrics
- [ ] Verify all services reporting metrics to Prometheus
- [ ] Confirm Grafana dashboards displaying data
- [ ] Test alerting rules with simulated violations
- [ ] Validate SLO monitoring active
- [ ] Confirm compliance monitoring operational

### 3. Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update public documentation
- [ ] Notify stakeholders of release
- [ ] Update internal wikis/knowledge bases
- [ ] Create deployment guides for operations teams
- [ ] Update training materials

### 4. Stakeholder Communication
```bash
# Send release announcement
# Include:
# - New features and improvements
# - Breaking changes (if any)
# - Migration instructions
# - Known issues and limitations
# - Support and feedback channels
```

## Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback
If critical issues are discovered post-release:

```bash
# 1. Immediate rollback to previous version
docker compose down
docker compose up -f docker-compose.v0.0.9.yml

# 2. Investigate issue
docker compose logs > rollback-investigation.log

# 3. Create hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/v0.1.1 v0.1.0

# 4. Apply fix and create patch release
git tag v0.1.1
git push origin v0.1.1
```

### Rollback Validation
- [ ] Previous version functionality confirmed
- [ ] Data integrity maintained
- [ ] Trading operations uninterrupted
- [ ] All stakeholders notified
- [ ] Incident report created
